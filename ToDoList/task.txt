It should be implemented using only HTML, CSS, JS.
What the app should do:
Users can enter a description of something they need to remember or accomplish and immediately see it appear in their task list.
All added tasks show up in an ordered list, with clear visual separation between items.
Each task has a control (e.g. a button or icon) that lets the user delete it from the list.
